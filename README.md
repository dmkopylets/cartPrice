# cartPrice
Backend technical test


**Goal**

Provide an endpoint that will consume the openexchangerates.org (feel free to use also any other solution) to calculate the cart value at current exchange rates, rounded to 2 decimal places. Must be written in PHP.  The source code of the project should include automated tests.
